# Markdown has no nesting at equal fence length. Inside a ```markdown template,
# a ```bash line is text, and the example's closing ``` ends the template, so
# the rest of it renders as headings and prose.

# A closing fence is allowed up to three spaces of indentation regardless of how
# far the opener was indented (CommonMark; GitHub renders it that way). The
# helper used to also require the closer's indent to be <= the opener's, which
# read GitHub-valid documents as still-open: lint reported a false "does not
# nest" and the OpenClaw split kept the following "##" heading inside the block.

## Identity
Enough words to clear the short-body warning, repeated so the linter has a
body to read: this fixture exists to check how fenced code blocks are parsed.
## Core Mission
Show a template that contains a code example.
## Critical Rules
Keep fences balanced.
